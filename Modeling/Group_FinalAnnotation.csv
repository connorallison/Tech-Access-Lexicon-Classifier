There should be rewards for people who give up their car use for a few days a week and use public transportation. A reward for recycling over using the regular trash bin. There should be a plastic tax and a gasoline tax. In Mexico City, you can only use your car on specific days of the week. San Antonio is waiting to get that polluted before doing that, but do it now. ThereÕs not enough publicity by the city on the state of pollution in San Antonio, nobody cares because the city does nothing to encourage and promote green living. Why are there no Òbad airÓ alerts on our phones from the city, even though the weather apps are saying itÕs a bad air day here? The city can do more to make us aware.

I acknowledge the city has done a fantastic job revamping downtown and creating beautiful spaces for tourists but I'm saddened to see the exponential growth of gentrification and displacement of native San Antonians. Our downtown is being bought up by outsiders. While it is shiny and nice, I've noticed I feel less safe downtown now. The cost to come downtown for the day is ridiculous with sky high parking rates. I feel this will another way of segregating an already incredibly segregated city. 
I worry about the sustainability of this unchecked growth. I worry about our aquifer. I worry about the urban sprawl that has crept far beyond 1604 and has removed the natural beauty of our land. Everything is for sale for the right price now.
